# Social Media Platform (Name TBD)
To address the Dell Hack to Hire problem, we decided to address the question: How can we create a social media platform that fosters learning, growth, and collaboration?

The approach we took was to create a social media platform that allows individuals to post their completed and currently in-progress projects. They submit information about their project. There is a "What I Learned" section and a "Challenges" section for individuals to learn from others' mistakes and promote a transparent, open learning environment.
